Learning to use GitPod and GitHub. Very frustrating so far.
Using git status in TERMINAL
Using git init   in TERMINAL

used commands in TERMINAL
seems it is working now 
example:
gitpod /workspace/Project-1 (main) $ git init
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /workspace/Project-1/.git/
gitpod /workspace/Project-1 (main) $ git status
On branch main Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
gitpod /workspace/Project-1 (main) $
